# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-system-inventlix.git
cd inventory-system-inventlix/backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following:
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver


# Frontend Setup
cd ..
cd ./frontend

# Install Dependencies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Known Limitations

- The system is currently designed for a single admin user.
- User registration and role-based access control are not implemented.
- Images are stored locally in the backend's `media/` directory (not on cloud storage).
- SQLite is used for development; PostgreSQL is recommended for production.
- Error handling is basic and can be improved for better user experience.
- Product categories are hardcoded; only the following values are accepted during creation, updation, filtering: `["Electronics", "Stationery", "Apparel"]`
